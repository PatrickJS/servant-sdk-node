To fix this, we need standard formats for data.  If data does not change shape, it's easier for developers to build applications that work with it, and it allows users to import pre-existing data into those applications, increasing distribution and productivity of their data.  \n\nJSON Archetypes aim to be the most perfect representations of popular types of data.  Each Archetype includes properties only necessary to define and differentiate it from other types of data, and purposely excludes properties needed for specific use-cases.\n\n##Goals\n#####**Allow Your Users To Import Their Pre-Existing Data Into Your App Instantly**\nIt's hard enough to get users.  Especially when they have to manually enter the same ol' content (Products, Blog Posts, etc..) within your app.  Using JSON Archetypes they can import their data instantly, and get on with using what you've built!  \n\n#####**Easy Validations**\nWe've written validation rules right into each Archetype so you don't have to!\n  \n#####**Write Less Code**\nC'mon, are you really going to model yet another *Product* or *Blog Post* data object?  Together, we can build perfect representations of those, that should serve most use-cases.\n\n#####**Don't Hold Users' Data Hostage**\nIf your business plan is to hold users' data hostage so they can't leave, then that is just plain awful.  Instead, build an application that creates value out of their data, and let them know that the data they create within your application will have use elsewhere too.\n\n#####**Data Liquidity**\nImagine an internet where we can instantly port our pre-existing data into new applications.  Or exit an application, knowing the data we created while using it will be usable elsewhere.\n\n##Overview\n\n***STATUS: This is currently a work in progress.  We are waiting to recieve feedback on these before launching JSON Archetypes Version 1***\n\nEach JSON Archetype uses the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org \"http://json-schema.org\") format to describe the Archetype and its validation rules.  All of the Archetypes can be found in the `archetypes` folder.  JSON Archetypes focus on are meant to be lean and contain only the essential properties/attributes that define and differentiate types of data.  The challenge is to agree on what those properties/attributes are...\n\n**This Repo contains the following:**\n\n - JSON Schemas for each JSON Archetype\n - Tests to check if the JSON Archetype Schemas are valid per the JSON SCHEMA DRAFT 4 specs\n\n*This repo is only for defining schemas  If you're looking for helper methods to quickly instantiate valid Data Archetypes and work with them in your applications, check out the Servant SDKs.*\n \n**Feel free to contribute to the existing JSON Archetypes or create your own!**\n\n---\n\nThis project was started to be used in SDKs for [Servant - The Content Management Ecosystem](http://servant.co), and represents half of Servant's strategy for building a more liquid web.  The strategy looks like this:\n\n>**• Host User Data Separate From Applications That Use It:**  This is what [Servant](http://servant.co) does.  It's cloud hosting for User's data.  \n>**• Keep User Data In Standard Formats:**  This is what JSON Archetypes are, standard formats.\n\nThe benefits of this strategy are a big deal. Check out Servant if you get a chance.  Servant also splits the hosting revenue of its users with every application that integrates with Servant.\n\n---\n##Contributing\nAnyone who has a JSON Archetype in mind, or wants to add to existing JSON Archetypes is free to contribute.  Just follow these steps:\n\n - Fork this project.\n - Clone your forked project (which should now be in your github account) to your computer.\n - Create a branch and work on it to create/modify existing JSON Archetypes \n\nMore on how to contribute [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).\n\n##F.A.Q.\n###How Is This Different From Schema.org?\nSchema.org is different because their JSON schemas are intended to be used in HTML mark-up for search engines.\n\nJSON Archetype schemas do not have properties that pertain to use cases (e.g., SEO data).  Instead JSON Archetypes contain only properties commonly associated with the content, that help differentiate it from other types of data (e.g., Products have a *price*, Blog Posts have a *title*).\n\nJSON Archetypes are meant to be lean and flexible in all scenarios.  What use would SEO properties have if the data is being used in a mobile application?  Attaching properties to the Archetypes for infinite use cases would result in infinite bloat.\n\nApplications should convert JSON Archetypes to Schema.org schemas, if that application deals with HTML mark-up and SEO, leaving the JSON Archetype lean so that it can be used simultaneously in other apps.\n###As a Developer, JSON Archetypes are not robust enough for my application and I need to store more data than JSON Archetypes can hold (e.g. SEO data).  What should I do?\nThis is the most popular question and rightfully so.  You want to build a awesome application, but using JSON Archetypes feels limiting...\n\nFirst off, is the extra data you need specific to your application?  **95% of the time, developers want to add extra data/properties to the Archetypes which are only relevant to their particular applications**.  However, the JSON Archetypes must be kept lean and comprehensible for the sake of speed and ease-of-use in all scenarios.  For instance, what use would a mobile application have for SEO data if SEO data is stored in each Archetype?\n\nThere are infinite use cases for each JSON Archetype, and storing custom data for each use case would result in infinite bloat.\n\nInstead, we recommend two approaches: \n\n**Extend The Data Within Your Own Application:**  Set up a database and use it to store the extra data and the JSON Archetype ID to which it corresponds. \n\n**Propose Changes:**  If you think your extra data would suit many use-cases, propose adding it in the Issues area.\n\nIf this sounds too difficult to you, and you are leaning towards building an application that has its own custom data objects, remember that your users will have to manually enter data within your app, resulting in a barrier to entry, and redundancy that JSON Archetypes strive to get rid of.  You're also building another silo for your users to get stuck in.  If that's part of your business strategy, then fine (you evil person), but we will show people that there is better way with JSON Archetypes!  \n\nAlso, Servant will not only give you users but it literally splits its hosting revenue with applications that use JSON Archetypes.  Immediate revenue and an awesome community that you will miss out on...\n###As a User, how can I store extra data in each Archetype (e.g. obscure product details)?\nJSON Archetypes aren't going to be perfect for everyone.  But don't let the perfect be the enemy of good.  \n\nOccasionally, you may not be able to find room to squeeze in obscure details.  On the other hand, JSON Archetypes radically increase distribution and productivity of your data.  \n\n**Yes, you may miss a small detail, but more importantly, you will be able to show and use your data EVERYWHERE.**\n\n###I just found [this comic on XKCD](http://xkcd.com/927/) and it’s totally relevant bro.  If I paste it in here, will I be clever?\nYes, no one has ever done that before.  Thanks... \n\nNow, the rest of us have to get back to solving stuff.\n\n",
